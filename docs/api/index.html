          ‹h3-worldmap› custom element.

About the update/layout/paint flow:

 1. As long as we don't know the size of the SVG element, we can't
    draw the map, because we need to configure the D3-geo projection
    with the aspect ratio of the available space. We can only read
    this size/aspect ratio, once the browser has computed the layout.
 2. Therefore we start by rendering a loading spinner, to let the
    browser compute layout and assign the size of the SVG element.
 3. Once the aspect ratio of the SVG element is known, we can configure
    the D3-geo projection, accordingly reset the view box system of
    the SVG element (to the coordinates that the D3-geo projection
    will produce) and start to draw the map on it.
 4. All of obviously this happens on two successive frames (with
    a repaint in between them), which is why we need to render a
    loading spinner first.

 I intend to later use a Resize Observer, which would enable us to
 measure the size of the SVG element *after layout* and *before paint*,
 which is the exact moment where we should configure the D3-geo projection.
 I need to figure out if the Resize Observer gets notified of the
 initial size of the SVG element, that is, even without any resizing.

For instance, the `countries-50m.json` TopoJSON world atlas [see below]

Defined after first update and paint, thru a complicated
execution flow:

1. the `updated()` lifecyle event handler (called whenever
   the component’s update finishes and the element's DOM has
   been updated and rendered) registers a `requestAnimationFrame()`
   callback handler;
2. that will in turn measure the width and height of the
   SVG element, compute its aspect ratio and set this state
   property accordingly;
3. which will finally trigger a re-render of the SVG element
   by Lit, with the correct aspect ratio being available.</td><td>object</td><td></td>
